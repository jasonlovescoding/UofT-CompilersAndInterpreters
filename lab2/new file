We target this phase of lab as to fill in the production rules without ambiguity.
The first and most prominent ambiguity from the original lab spec lies in <declarations> and <declaration>. 
The empty production rule for <declaration> is removed to avoid the infinite loop going from producing an empty <declarations> and an empty <declaration> over and over again.
Then the ambiguity from expression with operators is handled by ordered embedding of different <expression op expression> into the production rule of expression,
instead of using an intermediate rule for binary_ops. An interesting trick is the use of %prec UMINUS as TA suggested. 
Another thing to notice is that in the original lab spec there is no support of comma ',' as it should for the language. We added that.

For testing we wrote
